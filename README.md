# This update includes ...
- Local addons support: 
	- allows using local_addons
	- allows using global addons alongside local_addons
	- locates ofxCmake within /local_addons directory
- Debug/Release build Separation:
	- debug build now appends ```_debug``` to the end of the all lib files and executable.
	- No more recompile when switchin between debug/release mode!
- Skip compilation:
	- skips compiling oF library, link it instead
	- skips compiling addons, link it instead
	- this also solves chaos in Clion's project tree by hiding unnecessary files
	- Currently it only supports ofxCv, ofxOpenCv, ofxImGui, but you can modify your addon. See ofxCv.cmake
- More addons!
	- see /addOns/external folder
- Tested on ..
	- latest oF (July 2024)
	- macOS (Primarty platform)
	- Ubuntu (limited recent testing)
- How to start
	- use updated /project/CMakeLists.txt
- Done by

# CMake for OpenFrameworks [Vers. 0.3]
ofxCMake enables you to easily compile [OpenFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc) projects using [CMake](https://cmake.org). The primary goal for its creation was to enable the use of Jetbrains' [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) in OF application development, but it should work in any other IDE that supports CMake, as well as in the command line.

This fork was originally created to give [almul0's fork](https://github.com/almul0/ofxCMake) of BuildPeter's [ofxCMake](https://github.com/BildPeter/ofxCMake) compatibility with OpenFrameworks 0.10.0, but it has evolved to work in a slightly different way than both.

Tested on macOS 10.11, 10.13, OF "0.10.0" (the master branch as of January 2018).

## Usage
### Basics:
1. Clone into `[OF DIR]/addons/ofxCMake`
2. Create a project using OF's Project Generator
3. Copy `ofxCMake/project/CMakeLists.txt` into your project's folder.
4. In your copy of `CMakeLists.txt`:
 1. Verify path of your OF folder.
 2. Set the name of your app.
4. Open with CLion or compile via terminal.
- Any `.cpp` file that is in your project's `src` folder will automatically be added to the project.  

### Options
* If you need to add your own static libraries add its path to the USER_LIBS list.
* If you need to add your own include directories, use the CMake command `include_directories`

### Addons
ofxCMake splits OF addons between *Internal Addons* (the ones that are distributed with OF) and *External Addons* (the ones that aren't).

#### Using Addons
- Add the name of the addon you want to use to the `OFX_ADDONS_ACTIVE` list in `CMakeLists.txt`. All sources, headers, and libs will be automatically added to your project.

#### Making your own addons

1. Create a `.cmake` file for your addon (e.g. `ofxNAME.cmake`). Check the supplied templates in `ofxCMake/addOns` for assistance.
2. Copy the file into `ofxCMake/addOns/external`.
3. Include your addon in `ofxCMake/modules/addOnsExternal.cmake` – e.g.
`include( ${OF_CMAKE_ADDONS}/external/ofxNAME.cmake`
4. You will now be able to use your addon in any OF project.

<!-- ## Description

This "addon" enables you to use CMake to build OpenFrameworks projects. It is not a traditional addon that you use to add functionality yo your apps; rather, it takes advantage of where addons are typically stored to more easily build your projects. -->

### Using the CLion IDE
1. Prepare your project as explained above.
2. Choose via CLion in the 'Open File or Project' the `CMakeLists.txt`.
- A prompt might ask, if you want to change the 'project root'. Ignore this.
- The CLion project files will be saved in  a '.idea' folder. If you want, you can ignore that in your git repo.


<!--
### Command Line Compilation
- Create a new directory in your project folder – e.g.: `mkdir build`
- Go into that folder
- type `cmake ..`
- **Compile:**  `make` (optional `-j4` to compile with 4 cores)

	```bash
	$ cd of/apps/myApps/newApp
	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build
	$ cmake ..
	$ make -j4
	```
- -->

## Development Philosophy
- The project file `CMakeLists.txt` is simplified for readability.
- Modular approach in which each OS has it's own .cmake files.
- Having all ofxCMake files in the addons folder has the following advantages:
	- Can easily be installed
	- It works within OF's file structure, without having to change anything that isn't supposed to be modified. Thus, OF can be updated easily.



## Compatibility
At the moment (Jan 2018) only Mac OS is fully tested.

The infrastructure for other OS's (Linux, Windows) is already set up.

<!-- Tested on MacOS 10.11 with cMake 3.2.1 and of 0.9.8 -->
